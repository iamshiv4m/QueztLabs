    content: `
# Building Scalable React Native Apps: Lessons from the Trenches

After years of building React Native applications for clients across industries, we've learned what separates apps that scale gracefully from those that become maintenance nightmares.

## Start with a Solid Architecture

The foundation of any scalable app is its architecture. We recommend a feature-based folder structure that groups related components, hooks, and utilities together.

\`\`\`
src/
├── features/
│   ├── auth/
│   ├── dashboard/
│   └── settings/
├── shared/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── hooks/
│   └── utils/
└── navigation/
\`\`\`

## State Management Done Right

Don't reach for Redux by default. For many apps, a combination of React Context, React Query, and Zustand provides a simpler, more performant solution.

## Performance from Day One

- Use FlatList for long lists, never ScrollView
- Implement proper image caching
- Profile early and often with Flipper
- Consider Hermes for Android

## The Testing Pyramid

We follow a testing strategy that emphasizes:
1. Unit tests for business logic
2. Integration tests for features
3. E2E tests for critical user flows

## Conclusion

Building scalable React Native apps isn't magic—it's about making good decisions consistently. Start with these foundations, and you'll be well on your way.

    content: `
# Design Systems Worth Building: A Practical Guide

A design system is only valuable if people use it. Here's how we approach building systems that teams actually adopt.

## Start Small, Think Big

Don't try to systematize everything at once. Start with the components you use most: buttons, inputs, cards, typography.

## Document as You Go

Every component should have:
- Usage guidelines
- Code examples
- Accessibility notes
- Do's and don'ts

## Make Adoption Easy

The easier it is to use your system, the more it will be used. Provide:
- Copy-paste code snippets
- Figma components that match code 1:1
- Clear upgrade paths

## Conclusion

The best design system is one that grows with your product. Start simple, iterate based on real usage, and always prioritize developer and designer experience.

# Next.js Performance: From Good to Great

Next.js gives you great performance out of the box, but there's always room for optimization. Here's how we take apps from good to great.

## Image Optimization

Always use next/image. It handles:
- Lazy loading
- Responsive sizing
- WebP conversion
- Blur placeholders

## Code Splitting

Next.js splits code automatically, but you can help:
- Use dynamic imports for heavy components
- Lazy load below-the-fold content
- Consider route-based code splitting

## Caching Strategies

Leverage ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) for pages that change infrequently. Use SWR for client-side data fetching with stale-while-revalidate patterns.

## Conclusion

Performance optimization is an ongoing process. Measure, optimize, and measure again.
